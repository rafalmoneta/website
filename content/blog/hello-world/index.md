**Hello, world!** 🌍 

I created this blog for the purpose of the #100daysOfCode challenge which I will start someday. I hope to write every day about my progress, what  I have learned and on what projects did I work. Besides that, I want to try to write some technical/tutorials post and improve my English and writing skills.

My next goals are: 
- finish the personal website,
- create PokemonApp with json-server,
- and do a simple budget app,
- create a blog with datoCMS (*maybe)

Wish me luck and I see you around.

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World! My name is ...")
}
```
